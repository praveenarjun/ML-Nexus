# E-commerce Sales Prediction Model: Big Mart Sales Dataset  

This project involves building a predictive model to forecast sales for an e-commerce platform using the **Big Mart Sales dataset** from Kaggle. The goal is to handle missing values, perform data preprocessing, and train regression models to accurately predict the `Item_Outlet_Sales`. The final model is deployed using **Streamlit** for easy interaction with end-users.

## Overview  
Predicting sales accurately helps companies plan inventory, optimize operations, and maximize profits. This project utilizes advanced data preprocessing techniques, such as handling missing values, imputation, and feature encoding. We experimented with two regression models, Random Forest and XGBRFRegressor, to find the best-performing model. The final solution is deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time prediction.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is the **Big Mart Sales dataset** available on Kaggle. It contains information about products, their attributes, and corresponding outlet sales.  

**Key Attributes:**
- `Item_Identifier`: Unique product ID  
- `Item_Weight`: Weight of the product  
- `Item_Fat_Content`: Fat level in the product  
- `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: Year the outlet was established  
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`: Target variable representing sales  

---

## Libraries Used  
The following libraries were used in this project:  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing tools  
- **XGBoost**: Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- **Pickle**: Model serialization  
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for deployment  

---

## Preprocessing Steps  
1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Used **univariate imputation** (mean, median, and interpolation) for `Item_Weight`.  
   - **KNN imputation** was applied for more robust filling.  
   - `Outlet_Size` missing values were handled using mode imputation by grouping with `Outlet_Type`.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
   - Standardized `Item_Fat_Content` values to consistent labels.  
   - Replaced zero values in `Item_Visibility` using linear interpolation.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created a new feature `Outlet_Age` using the current year and outlet establishment year.  
   - Encoded categorical columns with **OrdinalEncoder**.

## Models Used  
We experimented with the following regression models to predict sales:  

1. **Random Forest Regressor**  
   - Used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance using the RÂ² score.  
   - Achieved moderate performance, but with scope for improvement.

2. **XGBRFRegressor (Best Model)**  
   - This model provided the highest accuracy.  
   - Feature importance analysis showed the most influential variables, including `Item_Type` and `Outlet_Location_Type`.

3. **Model Evaluation and Deployment**  
   - The model was tested on unseen data with **train-test split** (80/20).  
   - Achieved low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test data.

## Deployment  
The model is deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing users to input product details and receive sales predictions instantly. The trained model is saved as `bigmart_model.pkl` for easy reuse.

## How to Run the Project  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure the following software and libraries are installed:  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **XGBoost**  
- **Streamlit**  

### Steps to Clone and Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd e-commerce-sales-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the link generated by Streamlit to interact with the model in your browser.

## Results  
The final XGBRFRegressor model performed best, with predictions achieving high accuracy and low error. For example, on unseen data, it predicted a sales value with a margin of Â±714.42 units, offering a practical range for planning.  

---

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how to handle missing data, engineer features, and build predictive models using both traditional and advanced machine learning algorithms. The deployment with Streamlit enables seamless interaction with the model, showcasing its practical application in e-commerce forecasting.
