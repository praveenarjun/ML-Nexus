# Food Delivery Time Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model that predicts food delivery time based on various input factors. The model is built using XGBoost and deployed with Streamlit for a simple and interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: XGBoost-based regression model for predicting delivery times.
- **User Interface**: Streamlit is used to create an interactive web application where users can input features and get predictions in real time.
