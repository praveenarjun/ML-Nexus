## DESCRIPTION
This project aims to build an intrusion detection system (IDS) leveraging the power of Apriori algorithm and association rule mining to analyze network traffic data. 

- **Requirement**: The project is required to detect unusual patterns in network traffic that may indicate malicious activity or security breaches.
- **Necessity**: In todayâ€™s digital age, cybersecurity is crucial to protect sensitive data and maintain trust in technology infrastructures.
- **Benefits**: This IDS can help organizations quickly identify and respond to potential threats, thereby enhancing security measures.
- **Approach**: I started by exploring existing datasets, followed by a detailed analysis of features relevant to network traffic and potential intrusions. 
- **Resources Used**: I referred to the book "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques" by Jiawei Han and Micheline Kamber (Pages 245-280), along with various research papers on intrusion detection systems.

## EXPLANATION

### DETAILS OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES
- **duration**: Duration of the connection in seconds; can indicate the persistence of connections.
- **src_bytes**: Number of bytes sent from the source; high values may suggest large data transfers.
- **dst_bytes**: Number of bytes sent to the destination; similarly, high values can indicate substantial outgoing data.
- **land**: A binary feature indicating whether the source and destination IP addresses are the same; may suggest suspicious behavior.
- **wrong_fragment**: Number of wrong fragments; an indicator of possible packet fragmentation issues or attacks.
- **urgent**: Number of urgent packets; high counts may signify a potential attack strategy.
- **hot**: Number of "hot" indicators; can indicate frequent access to certain services, possibly leading to vulnerabilities.
- **num_failed_logins**: Count of failed login attempts; a high value can indicate brute-force attack attempts.
- **logged_in**: A binary feature indicating whether the user is logged in; essential for determining user activity.
- **num_compromised**: Number of compromised conditions observed; helps in assessing the security of the connection.
- **root_shell**: Indicates whether a root shell was obtained; a critical indicator of privilege escalation.
- **su_attempted**: Number of times a superuser (root) account access was attempted; may indicate unauthorized access attempts.
- **num_root**: Count of root accesses; essential for assessing potential breaches.
- **num_file_creations**: Number of file creation attempts; can indicate unusual behavior, especially in a user context.
- **num_shells**: Number of shell accesses; can indicate multiple command executions that may be part of an attack.
- **num_access_files**: Count of file accesses; frequent accesses might suggest data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
- **num_outbound_cmds**: Number of outbound commands; can indicate malicious activities or command execution on remote systems.
- **is_host_login**: Indicates whether the login is from a host; useful for differentiating between local and remote logins.
- **is_guest_login**: Indicates whether the login is from a guest user; can help identify unauthorized access attempts.
- **count**: Total number of connections to the same host; helps in analyzing connection patterns.
- **srv_count**: Number of connections to the same service; assists in identifying common services being targeted.
- **serror_rate**: Rate of connection requests that resulted in a "service unavailable" error; higher rates may indicate issues.
- **srv_serror_rate**: Rate of service errors; helps in understanding the reliability of the service.
- **rerror_rate**: Rate of connection requests that resulted in a "connection refused" error; can indicate network issues or attacks.
- **srv_rerror_rate**: Rate of service connection refusals; provides insights into potential denial-of-service scenarios.
- **same_srv_rate**: Rate of connections to the same service; higher rates might indicate unusual behavior or patterns.
- **diff_srv_rate**: Rate of connections to different services; helps in understanding the diversity of services accessed.
- **srv_diff_host_rate**: Rate of connections to different hosts for the same service; can reveal spread or targeting strategies.
- **dst_host_count**: Total connections to the destination host; provides an overview of traffic directed at a specific host.
- **dst_host_srv_count**: Number of connections to the same service on the destination host; helps identify service-specific attacks.
- **dst_host_same_srv_rate**: Rate of connections to the same service on the destination host; can indicate service targeting.
- **dst_host_diff_srv_rate**: Rate of connections to different services on the destination host; helps in assessing service access diversity.
- **dst_host_same_src_port_rate**: Rate of connections from the same source port to the destination host; may suggest persistence or targeted attacks.
- **dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate**: Rate of connections to different hosts for the same service on the destination; helps identify distributed access.
- **dst_host_serror_rate**: Rate of service errors for the destination host; higher rates might indicate issues affecting access.
- **dst_host_srv_serror_rate**: Rate of service connection refusals for the destination; useful for identifying denial-of-service scenarios.
- **dst_host_rerror_rate**: Rate of connection refusals for the destination host; can help identify network attacks.
- **dst_host_srv_rerror_rate**: Rate of service connection refusals for the destination host; aids in understanding overall service reliability.
- **class_anomaly**: This feature classifies whether the data point represents normal behavior or an anomaly.

### WHAT I HAVE DONE
1. Step 1: Conducted initial data exploration and understanding.
