## 🚀 Problem Statement
Accurate market regime detection is crucial for investors and traders. Identifying whether the market is in a bull, bear, or neutral phase can significantly influence trading strategies and risk management.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project employs clustering algorithms to categorize market regimes based on features derived from stock price movements.

### Key Components
| Component               | Description                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Collection**     | Historical stock data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.       |
| **Data Preprocessing**  | Calculating daily returns, moving averages, and volatility. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Normalizing data for effective clustering.                  |
| **Clustering**          | K-Means clustering is used to classify market regimes.      |
| **Model Validation**    | Evaluating the effectiveness of detected regimes.           |

## 📦 Installation & Usage
To get started, ensure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

| Library          | Installation Command                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Pandas**       | `pip install pandas`                     |
| **NumPy**        | `pip install numpy`                      |
| **Matplotlib**   | `pip install matplotlib`                 |
| **Scikit-learn** | `pip install scikit-learn`               |
| **yfinance**     | `pip install yfinance`                   |

## ⚙️ Alternatives Considered
Several alternative approaches were evaluated, including:

| Alternative Approach       | Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Machine Learning** | Algorithms like SVM and k-NN were considered; effective for smaller datasets but struggled with complexity. |

## 📊 Results
The model aims to classify market regimes accurately, providing valuable insights for trading strategies.

## 🔍 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the significance of time series analysis and clustering techniques in financial market analysis. The identified regimes can enhance decision-making processes for traders and investors.
