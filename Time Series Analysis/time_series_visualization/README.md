## **TIME SERIES VISUALIZATION**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The primary goal of this project is to implement a comprehensive framework for time series analysis and visualization, enabling users to extract meaningful insights from temporal data. By employing various statistical techniques and visualization methods, the project aims to help users understand patterns, trends, and seasonality within time series datasets.

### ðŸ§µ **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the Air Passenger dataset, which can be accessed from Kaggle. This dataset contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960, making it an excellent resource for time series analysis. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakannimer/air-passengers

### ðŸ§¾ **Description**

This project focuses on analyzing the Air Passenger dataset through a series of visualization techniques and statistical methods. Key aspects of the project include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarizing the dataset's characteristics to provide initial insights into its structure and distribution.
- Time Series Visualization: Employing various plotting techniques to visualize trends and seasonality.
- Trend Analysis: Identifying long-term trends and seasonal patterns within the dataset.
- Reporting: Generating a detailed report that encapsulates findings, visualizations, and statistical summaries.

### ðŸ§® **Steps undertaken**

- Data Loading: Utilized Pandas to load the dataset and performed initial data checks, including handling missing values and examining data types to ensure integrity.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to investigate data distribution, outliers, and correlations, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.
- Visualizations:

   - Autocorrelation Plot: Analyzed the correlation of the time series with its own lagged values to identify any periodic patterns.
   - Moving Average Plot: Visualized the moving averages to smooth out fluctuations and highlight trends.
   - Exponential Smoothing Plot: Implemented exponential smoothing techniques to assess trends while accounting for noise in the data.
   - Seasonal Plots: Generated seasonal decomposition plots to showcase seasonal variations and trends across different time frames.
   - Trend Analysis: Developed detailed trend analysis plots that highlight significant trends within the data over time.
- Report Generation: Compiled all findings, visualizations, and insights into a comprehensive PDF report, offering an accessible overview of the analysis process and results.

### ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**

- pandas: For data manipulation, analysis, and handling missing values effectively.
- numpy: For numerical operations and handling arrays efficiently.
- matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- seaborn: For enhanced visualizations that are aesthetically pleasing and informative.
- statsmodels: For statistical modeling, including time series analysis functions.
- scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms to enhance the modeling process.
