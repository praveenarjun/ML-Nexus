## üöÄ Overview
This project aims to develop a **Stock Price Prediction Model** that assists investors in making informed decisions based on historical stock data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this model provides insights into potential future trends, helping users identify buying or selling opportunities in the stock market.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock prices and includes the following features:

| Column Name | Description                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ticker**  | Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple)                  |
| **Date**    | Date of the stock prices                                     |
| **Open**    | Opening price on that date                                   |
| **High**    | Highest price during the trading day                         |
| **Low**     | Lowest price during the trading day                          |
| **Close**   | Closing price at the end of the day                          |
| **Adj Close**| Adjusted closing price (accounting for dividends and splits)|
| **Volume**  | Number of shares traded                                      |

## üîç Methodology
The project follows a structured approach to stock price prediction:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Historical stock prices are gathered from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and organized, ensuring consistency and handling any missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features, such as moving averages and technical indicators, are created to enhance the dataset.
4. **Model Training**: Various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) are implemented and evaluated.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is assessed using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
6. **Visualization**: Results are visualized to compare predicted vs. actual stock prices.
7. **Deployment**: A user-friendly web application is developed for real-time predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Used
| Algorithm                   | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**       | A basic regression technique to model the relationship between features and stock prices. |
| **Decision Trees**          | A tree-like model used for making predictions based on feature values. |
| **Random Forest**           | An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy. |

## üìà Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

| Metric                     | Description                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions. Lower values indicate better performance. |

## üé® Visualization
Visualizations are created to illustrate the model's predictions against actual stock prices, providing clear insights into performance and trends.
