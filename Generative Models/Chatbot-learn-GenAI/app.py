    "What is a GAN?": "A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other to generate new, synthetic instances of data that resemble real data.",
    "What is a VAE?": "A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that learns to encode input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decodes it to generate new data samples.",
