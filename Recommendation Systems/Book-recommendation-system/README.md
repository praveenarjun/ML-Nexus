# Book-Recommendation-System

This project is a Collaborative Book Recommendation System, which allows users to discover books based on their preferences and reviews from other users. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques, the system provides personalized recommendations. This project also includes user profiles and review features, similar to Goodreads, allowing users to interact with books by writing reviews and sharing their favorite reads.

## Features

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends books based on similar usersâ€™ preferences (user-user collaborative filtering)

2. **Book Ratings Dataset**: Analyze a dataset containing book ratings and reviews to make recommendations.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for use in the collaborative filtering algorithm.

4. **Visualization**: Display key data insights and recommendation results using charts and graphs.


## Setup

- Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
   ```

## Customization

- You can modify the system to fit your needs by:

1. Adding more advanced recommendation algorithms like matrix factorization or neural networks.
2. Improving dataset preprocessing to handle sparse data.
3. Experimenting with different similarity metrics or evaluation techniques.

## Future Improvements

- Content-Based Filtering: Combine collaborative filtering with content-based methods to enhance recommendations.
- Hybrid Model: Build a hybrid recommendation model by integrating various recommendation techniques
