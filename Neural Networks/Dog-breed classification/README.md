# Dog Breed Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying dog breeds using neural networks. The model is trained on a dataset of dog images, enabling it to identify different breeds based on their visual features.


## Overview

Dog Breed Classification is a project that leverages deep learning techniques to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds. It aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mobilenet_v2 in image recognition tasks.

## Dataset

The model is trained using the [Dataset : ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) which contains over 20,581 images across 120 breeds. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

To get started :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranshu-jais/ML-Nexus.git
