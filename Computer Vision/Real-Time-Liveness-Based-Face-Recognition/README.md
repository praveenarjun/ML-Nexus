# Real time liveness based face recognition system:

## Task:
Create a liveness detector capable of spotting fake faces and performing anti-face spoofing in face recognition systems.

## What is liveness detection and why do we need it?
Facial recognition software are gaining popularity and are increasing being implemented in various software and applications. <br>  
However, face recognition systems are easily fooled by “spoofing” and “non-real” faces. Hence comes the need for a system to determine whether the face is real or not. <br>

**Q. How would you go about spotting these “fake” versus “real/legitimate” faces? How could you apply anti-face spoofing algorithms into your facial recognition applications?**
<br>The answer is to apply liveness detection with OpenCV which is exactly what I’ll be covering today.

There are a number of approaches to liveness detection, including:
- Texture analysis
- Frequency analysis
- Variable focusing analysis
- Heuristic-based algorithms
- Optical Flow algorithms
- 3D face shape
- Combinations of the above
A full review of liveness detection algorithms can be found in Chakraborty and Das’ 2014 paper, [An Overview of Face liveness Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2227.pdf)

<u>Here we’ll be treating liveness detection as a binary classification problem.</u>
## Workflow:

1. Build the image dataset itself.
2. Implement a CNN capable of performing liveness detector (we’ll call this network “LivenessNet”).
3. Train the liveness detector network.

4. Create a Python + OpenCV script capable of taking our trained livenes detector model and apply it to real-time video.

## Project coming Together :
The final step is to combine all the pieces:
1. We’ll access our webcam/video stream
2. Apply face detection to each frame
3. For each face detected, apply our liveness detector model
## What does each script do?!:

1. `gather_examples.py` : This script grabs face ROIs from input video files and helps us to create a deep learning face liveness dataset.
    
2. `train.py` : As the filename indicates, this script will train our LivenessNet classifier. We’ll use Keras and TensorFlow to train the model. The training process results in a few files:

    i. `le.pickle`: Our class label encoder.
        
    ii. `liveness.model`: Our serialized Keras model which detects face liveness.
        
    iii. `plot.png`: The training history plot shows accuracy and loss curves so we can assess our model (i.e. over/underfitting).

3. `liveness_demo.py`: Our demonstration script will fire up your webcam to grab frames to conduct face liveness detection in real-time.

## Dependencies:

* Python 3, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
