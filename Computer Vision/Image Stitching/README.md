# Image Stitching with OpenCV

This project demonstrates image stitching using OpenCV, which combines multiple images into a single panoramic image. The code loads a set of images, performs feature detection and matching, and stitches them together to create a seamless panorama.

## Code Breakdown:

1. **Library Installation**:
   - Installs necessary libraries: OpenCV and Matplotlib.

2. **Function: `stitch_images`**:
   - **Loading Images**: Reads images from the specified file paths.
   - **Stitcher Object**: Creates an OpenCV Stitcher object to handle the stitching process.
   - **Performing Stitching**: Uses `stitcher.stitch()` to combine images.
   - **Error Handling**: Checks the status of the stitching process and returns the stitched image or an error message.

3. **Function: `display_result`**:
   - Displays the stitched image using Matplotlib.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - Upload to images you want to stitch.
   - Calls `stitch_images()` to perform the stitching and then displays the result.

## Possible Enhancements:
- **Input Flexibility**: Allow for dynamic input of image paths through user interface or file upload.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Apply image enhancement techniques before stitching for better results.
- **Advanced Matching**: Implement feature matching techniques (like SIFT or ORB) for improved alignment of images.

## Example Use Case:
This image stitching method is useful for creating panoramic images from a series of overlapping photographs, often used in photography, mapping, and virtual reality applications.

## Requirements:
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

### How to Run:
1. Install the required libraries.
2. Update the `image_paths` list with paths to your images.
3. Run the cell to perform stitching and view the result.
