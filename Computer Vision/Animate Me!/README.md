# Animate Me!

## About the Project:
- It is a simple OpenCV project that converts input image to a cartoon equivalent
- Unlike the classical approach, Image Quantization is used to differentiate regions

## Further Work / Improvements:
- Can convert into an API with self adjusting Edge Parameters
- Could be worked upon to create a real-time filter used on different social media platforms
