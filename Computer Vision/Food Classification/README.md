Food Image Classification with TensorFlow
=========================================

This project demonstrates food image classification using TensorFlow and a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. Users can upload an image of food and the model classifies it as either "pizza" or "burger."

Installation
------------

To install the necessary libraries, run the following command:

    !pip install tensorflow

Usage
-----

1.  Upload an image of food (either pizza or burger) using the provided file upload feature in Google Colab.
2.  The model will preprocess the image and make a prediction.
3.  The predicted class and confidence score will be displayed.

Code Breakdown
--------------

1.  **Library Installation**: Installs TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
2.  **Loading Pre-trained Model**:
    *   Loads the MobileNetV2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
    *   Freezes the base model's weights.
3.  **Model Creation**:
    *   Builds a custom model with a global average pooling layer and a dense output layer using sigmoid activation for binary classification.
4.  **Model Compilation**: Compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
5.  **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload images for classification.
6.  **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes the image, converts it to an array, and preprocesses it.
7.  **Making Predictions**: Classifies the uploaded image and outputs the predicted class and confidence score.

Possible Enhancements
---------------------

*   **Multi-Class Classification**: Extend to classify more food items.
*   **Data Augmentation**: Implement techniques to improve model accuracy.
*   **Web Interface**: Create a user-friendly web application for easy image uploads.

Example Use Case
----------------

This food image classification tool can be used for food identification, dietary tracking, and restaurant menu automation, allowing users to quickly classify and log their meals.

Requirements
------------

*   TensorFlow
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib

### How to Run

1.  Install the required libraries.
2.  Upload an image of food.
3.  Run the code to see the classification result and confidence score.
