# Fire Alarm Detection System

This project is a real-time fire detection system using OpenCV, threading, and email alerts. It utilizes a pre-trained fire detection cascade model and sends an alert via email and plays an alarm sound when fire is detected from video input.

## Features
- **Real-time fire detection** using OpenCV.
- **Alarm sound** triggered upon detection.
- **Email alert system** that sends notifications in case of fire.
- Simple and effective fire detection from live video or video files.

## Requirements
- OpenCV
- Threading
- Playsound
- smtplib
