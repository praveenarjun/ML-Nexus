# Hand Gesture Recognition with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand detection. Users can upload images containing hand gestures, which are then processed to identify specific gestures and display the results.

## Code Breakdown:

1. **Image Upload**:
   - Users can upload images directly through Google Colab, allowing for easy testing with various hand gesture images.

2. **Image Processing**:
   - **Hand Detection**: Uses MediaPipe to detect hands in the uploaded image.
   - **Gesture Identification**: Analyzes hand landmarks to identify simple gestures (e.g., "thumbs up").

3. **Visualization**:
   - Displays the processed image with detected hand landmarks and identified gestures using Matplotlib (`plt.imshow()`).

4. **Output**:
   - Prints identified gestures in the console for user reference.

## Possible Enhancements:
- **Gesture Variety**: Expand gesture recognition capabilities to include more complex gestures.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Implement real-time video feed recognition using webcam input.
- **Custom Configurations**: Adjust hand detection parameters to improve accuracy under different conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Add checks for unsupported image formats or cases where no hands are detected.

## Example Use Case:
This hand gesture recognition system can be utilized in applications such as sign language interpretation, human-computer interaction, or control systems that respond to hand gestures.

## Requirements:
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Matplotlib

### How to Run:
1. Upload your image file containing a hand gesture.
2. Run the cell to process the image and identify the gesture.
3. View the results, including the processed image and identified gestures, in the output.
